GenAI Usage: Throughout this project we've utlized GitHub Copilot and sometimes ChatGPT.
We used ChatGPT as a search engine to understand what various functions and tools accomplished and how to use them. We also leveraged ChatGPT for debugging, though we
made sure that we understood and agreed with its solutions before iplementing itse solutions. We also occasionally had ChatGPT generated some code for us, in which case we made sure to thoroughly review and understand it ourselves before committing it (i.e. test cases).
