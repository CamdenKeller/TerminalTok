  Not enough scrolling in your life?? Too much CS in your life? 
  We can fix that with our fun, interactive TerminalTok! It supports 
  posts, videos, and sharing videos directly from your terminal. Scroll, 
  watch, and share without ever leaving the command line. And when you're 
  offline, enjoy our very own version of the classic dinosaur game for even 
  more terminal-approved fun under the guise of productivity!
